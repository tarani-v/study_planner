AI: Unleashing Academic Potential

he aim of this project is to develop an AI-powered study planner designed to optimize the study routine for users. This innovative tool will allow users to input their available study time, after which the AI will generate a comprehensive schedule that outlines tasks and resources tailored to their specific needs.

Key features of the planner will include:

Personalized Study Schedule: Users can specify their time constraints, and the AI will create a detailed, task-by-task study plan. This plan will incorporate various subjects and topics, ensuring efficient use of the available time.

Resource Integration: The planner will recommend relevant resources, including instructional videos from platforms like YouTube, to enhance the learning experience and provide additional support for each task.

Leaderboard Functionality: To encourage engagement and motivation, the planner will include a leaderboard feature. Users will earn points for completing tasks, which will contribute to their overall stats and standings on the leaderboard.

Performance Tracking: Users will be able to monitor their progress through detailed statistics, including points earned and streaks achieved. This feature will help users stay motivated and committed to their study goals.

Overall, this AI-powered study planner aims to enhance academic performance by providing a structured, resource-rich approach to studying, while fostering a sense of community and competition through its leaderboard system.
